# weather_app

This app help you to have an idea of the weather in whatever city in the world, 
you just enter the city name and a few informations about the weather will be shown. 
That's my first work with APIs so I need to mention that I worked with the free API from "developer.accuweather.com". 
You can also see the code result on this link thanks to github pages: https://masaid24.github.io/weather_app/
